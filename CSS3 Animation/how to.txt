Add the animation stylesheet to the <head> element of your webpage:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/animations.css">



Add an animation class to the element you want animated:

<div id="object" class="slideUp">



For entrance animations, you need to make them invisible by adding the visibility: hidden property to the animated element:

#object{
	background-color: #fe5652;

	visibility: hidden;
}
